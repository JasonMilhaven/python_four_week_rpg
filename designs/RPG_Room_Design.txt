after initial testing, the game cannot draw tiles on the screen and run
at a playable framerate, even using Igor's method of int values for entity
position, the game drawing runs at 30 fps, and the logic runs at 15, allowing
the game to run any faster will result in massive screen tearing

the game will now use instances of a Room class to represent where the player is,
they will be part of the save files


class Game
 Player player
 get rid of the Program's reference to player
 list of rooms rooms
 
 constructor()
   rooms.append(new Room())
   player = new Player()

class Room
 two-dimensional array of Tiles tiles
 array of Rooms rooms[4]
 list of Entities entities
 
 constructor(win_width, win_height)
  for a in win_width / TILE_SCALE
   for b in win_height / TILE_SCALE
    tiles.append(new Tile(a, b))
